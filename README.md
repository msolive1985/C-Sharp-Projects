Given an array of lower case strings, the task is to find the number of strings that are distinct. Two strings are distinct if on applying the following operations on one string the second string cannot be formed.
Assumptions:
- A character on odd index can be swapped with another character at odd index only.
- A character on even index can be swapped with another character on even index only.
